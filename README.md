# TrueLayer To-Do List Challenge

Implemented a simple todo app with possibility to record user actions and play them back to the user.

## Useable demo

## Bundle process

To build both development and production bundles (found in **build/production /development**), run:

### npm run build

## Tests

To run unit tests:

### npm test

## Improvements

- **Design** - could be improved by implementing toggles to display only active todos or completed todos etc. Animations could be added to make the played user actions look less static while updating the UI.

- **Functionality** - the recording functionality could be used as a session history to allow the user to undo/redo their actions.
